# RISC-V CPU
I have implemented a complete RISC-V CPU from scratch using logisim-evolution capable of handling all the instructions.  
I have added implementation details and design images below.

## Individual Components
Below are the designs for each part of our CPU.

### ALU
Following is the design for our Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) and the result of the provided test cases.
